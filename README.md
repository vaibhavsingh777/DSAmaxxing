# DSAmaxxing

my plan: to watch Striver A2Z videos and then solve leetcode problems by myself. I will make notes(left digital note taking post sem 3) for DSA from strivers videos, and after every chapter completes just for backup I will also upload those notes in this repository.

for mastering DSA, I have to be consistent and make sure I am atleast able to solve all easy and medium problems on leetcode atleast before moving to the harder problems.

Remember always keep moving, dont stay stuck or stop, because my lifes biggest motivation has always been to persevere till the goal is not reached.

I will become a successful software developer one day.
